This project was done for my Data Mining and Generalized Linear Models course during fall 2022. 

The attached pdf contains an example of a report detailing the creation of a generalized linear model predicting success in a US presidential election based on a variety of predictive factors. The project uses SAS to clean data, build the model, and create visualizations.
